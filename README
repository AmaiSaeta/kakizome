Programming KAKIZOME
====================

KAKIZOME programs by AmaiSaeta.


## Rules

1. *publish "kakizome" repository* like GitHub and *add new KAKIZOME program each year*. 
2. KAKIZOME should been written by *"the first" language, library or programming paradigm*.
   Use the first something you might as well!
   Can challenge the tricky notation like "write FizzBuzz without conditional branching", if it is the first time writing.
3. *Do the first three days of the New Year* if possible.
4. *Recommendation is "output 'A Happy New Year (year number)'" program*.
   Because, "hello world" like program, it can expect to be able to write in various environments.
